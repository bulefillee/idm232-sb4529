       <h1> - A Case Study by Sue Batham</h1>

  <br>
    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <p>Embarking on a solo 11-week project, my mission with Apetique—a portmanteau with a French twist on 'Appétit'—was to architect a dynamic culinary exploration platform. 
        This endeavor delved into full-stack development, intertwining PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and Git to sculpt both front-end and back-end components. 
        The focal point was a responsive web application, meticulously designed to facilitate user-friendly exploration of a vast recipe library. 
        Notable features encompassed dynamic database interactions, adherence to responsive design principles, and the creation of an intuitive user interface. 
        Apetique represents the project's commitment to satisfying culinary enthusiasts' appetites through a dynamic online platform for discovering diverse recipes. 
        This project aimed not only to showcase technical prowess but also to deliver a seamless and engaging digital haven for culinary enthusiasts.</p>
